# Washington_Housing_Market_Regression_Analysis
- Mid Semester Regression Analysis Project: Python, MySQL and Tableau Files included
- In addition, each xlsx/csv files used for each analysis is provided

### Purpose of Project
- Develop the optimum regression model to predict target (price). .ipynb files contains comparison of all possible regression models with Linear Regression and K-Nearest Neighbors.
- Use MySQL to explore insights into data, including unique values and average prices based on various features
- Use Tableu to garder further insights, including those of house built from 1900-1999, 2000-2010, and 2010-beyond

### Problem Definition
